# OOPS:(object oriented programming system)
# oops is a real word entity
# oops is programming paradigm
# Paradigm:To solve a problem with (process/approach/method/stratagy/style/modules) for solvinng a problem or task
# There are five types here:
# 1) class and object
# 2)Inheritance
# 3) abstraction
# 4) polymorphisum
# 5) encapsulation


# use of oops
# oops allows clarity programming there by allowing simplicity in sloving  complex problems
# code can be reused through inheritance there by redcing redundancy
# code and data are boundedd together by encapsulation
# oops allows hiding the data
# problems can be divied in diffferent parts, making it simple solve
# it is bottom - up approach
