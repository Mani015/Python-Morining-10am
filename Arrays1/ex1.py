# ARRAYS
# An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
# The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.
# This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e.,
# the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).

import array as s
ar1=s.array('i',[1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
print(ar1)
# array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
